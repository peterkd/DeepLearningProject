# DeepLearningProject - Exploring Deep Learning Approaches for Classifying Sentiment using the IMDB Movie Review Dataset.
SCS 3546-010 Deep Learning Project
Group: Liam Callaghan, Peter Kiedrowski and Prashant Sharma

Sentiment analysis is a common and highly beneficial application of Deep Learning for many organizations. Sentiment analysis can be applied to social media posts, reviews and product complaints to name a few. There are numerous approaches to classify sentiment in Python. This project aims to explore just some of the availabel methodologies that are avilable in order to improve the accuracy for sentiment classification based on the TensorFlow Sentiment Analysis tutorial:

In this project, we focus on the most popular text dataset for Deep Learning, the IMDB movie reivew set. Using this data, we build and train a recurrent LSTM autoencoder to compress reviews and further extract the encoder layer for further training in an additional network for classifying sentiment. Furthermore, We apply the available BERT embeddings and GloVe embeddings to see if claissification performance improves.

Each of the three applied approaches are provided in seperate Python notebooks on this GitHub site.
